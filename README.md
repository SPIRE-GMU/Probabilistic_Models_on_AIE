# Probabilistic_Models_on_AIE

It's a basic method of building the probabilities models:

First, download the dataset from bnlearn

Then, analyze the dataset using the R script 

Given the result (junction tree, cliques, potentials) build AIE accelerators.


We choose 5 simple datasets as an example and illustrate the methodology of building the model in our paper.
